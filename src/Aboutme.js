        <p>
          Hello there! I am Auragail Jamaica Janoba, and I am currently 22 years
          old. My hometown is Sugod, Bacon District, Sorsogon City, where I have
          spent my academic years from elementary school to senior high school.
          I am adaptable and always willing to learn and grow from my
          experiences. In my free time, I enjoy reading, writing, and spending
          time indoors. Currently, I am studying at The Lewis College, pursuing
          a degree in BSIT, and I am looking forward to finish this semester
          soon.
